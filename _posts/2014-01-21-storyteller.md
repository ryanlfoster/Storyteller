This has been long due on [my](http://techapj.com/ "my") To-Do list, but I just kept pushing it, until I felt like I can't push it any further, and here it is, the brand new Jekyll theme, a totally different storytelling experience. I am calling it **Storyteller**.

I always had a keen interest in writing, and I wanted a blog which was easy to deploy and had faster load time, then I heard about Jekyll and Github Pages. What more can I ask for, super easy to deploy using **Git**, serves **Static HTML**, and on top of that can be hosted for **Free**.

I wanted a clean, clutterfree and super easy to read design. When [Ghost](https://ghost.org/ "Ghost") was launched, I was blown away by the default [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper "Casper") theme it came with, it was minimal and sophisticated, and I knew it's exactly what I wanted for my blog.

**Storyteller** was not just a weekend project for me, rather it took me over two months to make it usable and useful in general. It brings a lot of improvements over default Casper theme, like the sidebar which was inspired from [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/ "Lanyon") theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo "@mdo") using complete HTML/CSS, no JavaScript. [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/ "Font Awesome") is added for complete set of fonts, and many minor improvements.

The source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/techAPJ/Storyteller/ "Github"). The license for this theme, as for Ghost is MIT.

**Storyteller** is mainly inspired from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/ "Ghost") , and further inspiration came from [Medium](https://medium.com/ "Medium").

It was the morning of 8th December 2013, I woke up early morning and was pretty excited about 2013 state election results. Wait, did I just say that "I was excited about election results"? This doesn't sound like me. The people who are close to me will say that I haven't been excited about elections my entire life. Yup, this was the first time in my life, that I was taking Politics seriously, because I knew that in this election something big is about to happen, something that will change the face of India, something that will wipe the corruption from its root, something that will be truly democratic, something after which I will be truly able to say, that I am a Proud Citizen of India and I witnessed the truly Historic moment.

I belong from a city named Jodhpur located in state Rajasthan, but it was not Rajsthan's election results I was worried about, my focus was on Delhi election results, because a man named Arvind Kejriwal was fighting election from Delhi for the first time in his life.

For the rare ones, who are wondering who is Arvind Kejriwal, and why is he so important to this guy, let me tell you in brief:

Arvind Kejriwal is a graduate of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. He is a former Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer and former Joint Commissioner in the Income Tax Department. In 2006, he resigned from IRS, to work full time as social activist. In 2012, he launched Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), to clean the corruption, widespread in Indian Politics.

While his educational qualifications and prestigious job aside (even though I can't deny that they sure do matter), the man struck a chord with me when he actively participitated (and was the part of core team) in the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement, that movement was the most striking movement I witnessed in my life, millions of people joined hands to declare their dissatifaction against corruption widespread in Indian Political System, and it made me feel that something big is about to happen, people do have power to revolutionalize the system, I knew why democracy is so important that day.

While the IAC movement was hugely successful but Mr. Kejriwal realised that to bring complete change in Poltics and to remove corruption from its root, he had to enter in Politics himself. It was a very bold decision and was accepted very crtically by core team of IAC itself, but Mr. Kejriwal knew that it needs to be done, to see the change he wanted to see and to visualize the dream he had for better India.

Until now I had the notion that Politics is a sort of disease, you can't be cured once you get into politics and it will drown you, but Mr. Kejriwal proved me wrong, he showed me that if you have a firm determination, properly channelled anger and a strong desire to do something, then nothing is impossible. It made me remember Mahatma Gandhi's quote:

> Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

While I was writing this article, I heard the live press conference of Mr. Kejriwal, and I was shocked to hear some of the facts which he mentioned in his conference. The most striking one was:

> AAP party asked for Rs. 20 crore donation, and after fulfilling the goal of Rs. 20 crore, the party rejected to accept any more donation. I think it's the first time in history that any political party rejected to accept donation before election and provided the detailed analysis of the whereabouts of donation expenditure.

Until now we only used to see this in Indian Cinemas (Nayak, A Wednesday) that how a common man (Aam Aadmi) can change the system and show the real power of Aam Aadmi, but I think we all can agree now that it's possible in real life too.

I salute Mr. Kejriwal, for showing me that even a common man have a power to challenge the system.

By the time I finished writing this article, the results were declared, even though I was disapointed at first that Aam Aadmi Party did not win with majority, but the good thing was AAP pulled to make a difference in this election results. The electon results showed that AAP secured 28 seats, which in itself is a very big win for any political party who fought their election for the first time, and even better news was that no party in Delhi was able to secure majority of votes.

Today I can say with confidence that Yes, my India is shining, and I can see a brighter future.

Thank You, Mr. Kejriwal, you truly are a motivation for young generation of India.
